# Generate a _PYRO4BOT_

## Getting started



## Prerequisites
* Python 3.5 or above
* Having your robot already built

## Installing

### First step
Execute the python file with a name for your custom robot like this:
```
python3 generate_robot.py my_robot
```

### Second step
Then, you will have a new directory named _*robots*_ with your robot _my_robot_ inside, it's just
another folder with the name of your robot.

That folder should have a structure like the following:
```
/developing
/init
    /generate_robot.py
    /robots
        /my_robot
            /start.py
            /my_robot.json
            /components
            /services
            /clients
```

The description of your robot is the json file, _my_robot.json_, there you must complete with the 
components and services required to run your robot.

### Third step

 _...still **TODO**_

<!-- Template for the Readme.me

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Raspberry Pi (any model)
* Raspbian OS or similar OS compatible
* ...


```
Give examples
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo



## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system


## Built With

* Python 3.5
* Pyro 4
* Raspbian OS (version...
